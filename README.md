# bot
A easy to use bot for my roblox revival with easy to add addons!

# Setting up

To setup the bot you will need:
- A website domain
- Backend Support or just the website.
- Python

## Config + Booting Up
Add all your stuff in the config.example.py file. Then, rename it to config.py.
Now, all you have to do is open a command prompt to the directory and do a command like "python main.py" then you are done!
